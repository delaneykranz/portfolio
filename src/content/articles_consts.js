    content: ["IT’S THE SUBWAY, shaking, quaking, they never seemed to get the repairs right, no, it goes just long enough without a shriek of metal, a few moments, and you think it is safe, but then there is a slight turn in the tracks, and the brakes yelp and wail. No, they never seem to fix anything at all. There was mold once, someone told you, and it shut the whole place down for a day. What a mess. They always try to make it convenient, of course, a few hours closed between one and three in the morning, but look at everyone around you right now; this place is never dead, there’s always someone in need of a ride, of course, in a city such as this.",

        "IT’S THE SUBWAY, and the air is as thick as your mother’s sarcasm when you said you were going to the city. The water from the humidity sticks to everything, skin, hair, it is all damp. The glinting metal of the walls are cool to the touch, but the unfathomable amount of bodies that have pressed against them make them repulsive. People avoid touching them, like some sick game of Operation, how close can you get, how close can you get, just don’t touch, barely. The seats are optimal—people crowd on, a throng of bodies throwing themselves, rag dolls with the target of the sticky plastic backs of chairs. The poles go next, appendages wrapping around their smooth metal in an act of dominance, this is my territory, find a different spot. At least grimy poles are meant to be touched-- the possibility of germs on them bothers no one. Leftover people cling to nothing; precariously balancing, forced to undergo sudden stops and starts.",

You’re here for ages every day, the one lurker who showers, back and forth on those rusted rails, your ass melding to your sticky plastic seat, day, night, it doesn’t matter, IT’S THE SUBWAY.

        "A nice, rounded, literary way to start and end it would be to begin right when I was 19 and got crushed by a Mustang on the southwest corner of Myrtle and University. I remember tipping back off my longboard and laying on the sidewalk, vibrating with nerves, in awe at the clear sky above me. My left foot was pinned under two-thousand pounds of car, and I was shrieking and cursing up a blue streak as I thought ", <i>Ah, I guess I could have died here.

        "And then I could go into the whole ", <i>Eat, Pray, Love</i>," sort of growth where I limp around Europe and realize how beautiful the world is. I could end it by standing in my Tempe dorm and looking at the purplish scar of tread marks that scampers up my foot, make some overused metaphor about how my feet have walked me around God’s beautiful Earth, and close out with a fat, single tear of pride rolling down my cheek. But that wouldn’t be accurate, as I was already signed up to study abroad before Jennifer in her 2009 sedan ran me down when she didn’t check before turning right. ",
        <br/>, <br/>,
        "Maybe it began when I was eight, when I would sit at my dad’s ancient desktop and type out stories in 15pt font about me and my little black dog, Pepper, going on adventures. I would run around the elementary school, the blonde corkscrew curls on my head bouncing, and pass out my printouts to anyone who would take them. But this did not begin there, as I only knew Glendale, Arizona as a kid, and the outside world was hardly an idea to me, for everything my brain concocted on its own was far more interesting.",

        "To my surprise, this recollection of stories show a great deal of growth within me. I begin as a very pissed person. (I thought I still was a pissed person, but it seems I have softened over time, like a pat of butter left out on the windowsill.) My narration style is typically pretty cynical, but you may notice that a self-esteem appears to crop up and grow during the course of this story. This collection also goes on a complete spin near the end, which brings me a lot of joy—I like unpredictable twists in stories—as I realize that perhaps I am not nearly as worldly and cultured as I thought I once was.",

        "There is also the question as to the value of a story like this. Who cares about another upper-middle-class white girl wandering around the earth? Who cares about an eight-year-old’s stories about her dog that have a font size the size of the Sun? ",

        "My answer for that is a bit of a cop-out. I could go the MFA English class’s route and argue about the inherent value of storytelling, maybe throw in a few buzzwords like “personification” or “reduction”, but I did not write this thesis to bullshit you. Beneath my iron-clad words and snarky phrases there lies something shy and awkward. Something kind of squishy. Something that hopes you like the story, and that maybe, it made you think about something, or feel better that someone else feels that way. I do not write for world domination. I just hope someone else reads this and exhales a little through the nose. Maybe says, “hmph.” Maybe nods along to the jagged rhythm of my phrases.",
