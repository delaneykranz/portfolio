    content: ["IT’S THE SUBWAY, shaking, quaking, they never seemed to get the repairs right, no, it goes just long enough without a shriek of metal, a few moments, and you think it is safe, but then there is a slight turn in the tracks, and the brakes yelp and wail. No, they never seem to fix anything at all. There was mold once, someone told you, and it shut the whole place down for a day. What a mess. They always try to make it convenient, of course, a few hours closed between one and three in the morning, but look at everyone around you right now; this place is never dead, there’s always someone in need of a ride, of course, in a city such as this.",

        "Everything is shiny. Everything is dull. The walls were once unscathed steel, but, like everything, it tarnished. Hood rats and absentminded fingernails scrabble every surface, etching human life into the doors, the poles, the seats, everything. Gang signs [[[Latin Kings, a classic]]] and love signs [[[G + A = <3]]] and vague remarks [[[Beth Was Here 2012]]] float on the walls around you, a mosaic of mindless graffiti. Nothing is untouched. Nothing is sacred.",

        "IT’S THE SUBWAY, and the air is as thick as your mother’s sarcasm when you said you were going to the city. The water from the humidity sticks to everything, skin, hair, it is all damp. The glinting metal of the walls are cool to the touch, but the unfathomable amount of bodies that have pressed against them make them repulsive. People avoid touching them, like some sick game of Operation, how close can you get, how close can you get, just don’t touch, barely. The seats are optimal—people crowd on, a throng of bodies throwing themselves, rag dolls with the target of the sticky plastic backs of chairs. The poles go next, appendages wrapping around their smooth metal in an act of dominance, this is my territory, find a different spot. At least grimy poles are meant to be touched-- the possibility of germs on them bothers no one. Leftover people cling to nothing; precariously balancing, forced to undergo sudden stops and starts.",

        "IT’S THE SUBWAY, and it is loud, and it is silent. The brakes hiss and squeal [[[EEEEEE]]], switches in the track clanking [[[ch CHch ch CH]]], mechanics shifting [[[shhhh]]]. The people avoid eye contact. ",
